Hello! I'm an 3rd year Ph.D. Student at [Cornell CS](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/) advised by [Abe Davis](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/abe/group/). My interests lie broadly in the field of computational imaging, where I aim to codesign hardware (e.g., embedded systems, optics) and algorithms for content creation-related tasks. My work is supported by an [NDSEG fellowship](https://ndseg.org/). 

Previously, I was a Master's student at the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/) in Seattle, where I worked in [GRAIL](https://grail.cs.washington.edu/). I also completed my undergraduate degree (2018-2021) in computer engineering at the Allen School.
