Hello! I'm a Master's student at the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/) in Seattle. I work with [Prof. Ira Kemelmacher-Shlizerman](https://www.irakemelmacher.com/) and [Dr. Soumyadip Sengupta](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~soumya91/) in [GRAIL](https://grail.cs.washington.edu/).

I also completed my undergraduate degree (2018-2021) in computer engineering at the Allen School.

I'm currently a Research Intern at [Runway](https://runwayml.com/) (they're hiring!), working to create improved, interactive virtual green-screening algorithms using machine learning.

<mark>I'm looking to start a Ph.D. in this and related areas beginning Fall 2022! Please reach out to me via email or Twitter DM (below) if I seem like a good fit.</mark>
