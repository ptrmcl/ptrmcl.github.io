Hello! I'm an incoming Ph.D. Student at [Cornell CS](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/).

Previously, I was a Master's student at the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/) in Seattle, where I worked in [GRAIL](https://grail.cs.washington.edu/). I also completed my undergraduate degree (2018-2021) in computer engineering at the Allen School.

I recently also completed a research internship at [Runway](https://runwayml.com/) (they're hiring!), where I led efforts to create improved, interactive virtual green-screening algorithms using machine learning.

My general interests lie at the intersection of computer graphics, vision, and machine learning, where I aim to create powerful tools and put them into the hands of content creators around the globe.
